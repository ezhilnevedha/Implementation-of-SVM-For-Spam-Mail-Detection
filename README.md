# Implementation-of-SVM-For-Spam-Mail-Detection

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the SVM For Spam Mail Detection.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

### Algorithm for SMS Spam Classification

1. Use libraries like pandas for data handling and sklearn for machine learning tasks.    
2. Read the CSV file and handle encoding issues.     
3. Check for missing values, dataset shape, and column types.     
4. Separate the message text (v2) and label (v1) into variables.    
5. Divide the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.      
6. Transform text data into numerical format using CountVectorizer
7. Use a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for classification.
8. Fit the classifier on the training data.  
9. Generate predictions for the test set.
10. Calculate accuracy and assess performance using metrics.
